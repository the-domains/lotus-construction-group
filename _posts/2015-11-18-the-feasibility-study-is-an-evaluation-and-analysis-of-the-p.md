The Feasibility Study is an evaluation and analysis of the potential of a proposed project.  It is based on our Client's wishes and technical research to support the process of decision-making.  In its simplest terms, the two criteria used to judge feasibility are cost required, and value to be attained. One of the common pitfalls in the remodeling process is to jump into advanced design and contractual obligations, with little or no thought with regard to budget constraints.  This often leads to a design that, albeit beautiful, is not affordable to build.  With our Feasibility Study we evaluate the project's potential for success, with minimal investment required. Our feasibility studies aim to: 1\.         Objectively and rationally discover the strengths and weaknesses of an existing residence. 2\.         Understand your needs and wishes regarding your project. 3\.         Develop an accurate as-built floor plan of your home. 4\.         Produce schematic concepts of your project with thoughtful, considerate design. 5\.         Provide a Free Cost Analysis Estimate of your design. Our feasibility studies precede technical development and advanced design development and project implementation.
