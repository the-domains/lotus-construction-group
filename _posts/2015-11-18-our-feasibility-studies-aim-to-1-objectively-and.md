Our feasibility studies aim to: 1\.         Objectively and rationally discover the strengths and weaknesses of an existing residence. 2\.         Understand your needs and wishes regarding your project. 3\.         Develop an accurate as-built floor plan of your home. 4\.         Produce schematic concepts of your project with thoughtful, considerate design. 5\.         Provide a Free Cost Analysis Estimate of your design. Our feasibility studies precede technical development and advanced design development and project implementation.
